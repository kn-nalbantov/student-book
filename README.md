# student-book
Space for creating student lists and more

**Disclaimer:**
**This is a work in progress. Not all features are completed nor have been fully tested. As such some bugs are to be expected.**

# About:
This is my first React project which I am building using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It helps you create student lists and export them to excel tables.
I was inspired to start working on it to help teachers in my family who were forced to start teaching remotely during the pandemic ðŸ’¡ and are now learning to use alot of tech. Just as I am learing ðŸ”¥

# Future features:
I am currently working on a database to collect the student lists. Imports are to be implemented and I have tons of other stuff in mind such as grades, average grade calculator and opening/closing different class lists.
I hope I will have enough time to work on them and get them out asap!

## update:
coming back to this project after a long hiatus. I will be using node.js and filesystem methods to save entries instead of indexDB or other browser DBs || more to come soon!
